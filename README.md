# Mail attachement extractor

I use this program in synergy with procmail to extract mail attachment from
each email I receive on my server. 

In addition I use owncloud to let these files be available and searchable from
a web interface.

* What to expect:
    - It is fast and does not consume a lot of memory
    - Handle UTF-8 file name
    - Handle ASCII extended file name
    - Tested on more than 3000 mails

* What not to expect:
    - The email must be well formed, undefined behaviour if not
